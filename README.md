## Overview

This repository contains a simplified version of the R code developed for my Masterâ€™s thesis.
The code demonstrates the main analytical steps used to assess the impact of Russian immigration to Georgia on housing affordability.

It reproduces a minimal working example of the data preparation, econometric modeling, and visualization workflow.

## What the script does

* Compiles and merges two datasets:

  * A time-series dataset with nationwide indicators
  * A panel dataset with city-level rent and inflation data
* Constructs rate variables and shock indicators for key migration periods
* Estimates:

  * OLS models to analyze the relationship between rent inflation and migration shocks
  * Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models for city-specific dynamics
* Visualizes rent price growth and major migration shock periods in Georgia
